# REEL EYES ReviewVisualizer-TigerHacks2023

## About the Project

This project is our submission to University of Missouri's TigerHacks 2023 event. The project scrapes movie review text from critics' reviews on Rotten Tomatoes for a given movie title and returns two visualizations.

1. A word cloud of the significant words in the movie reviews
2. A bar plot of the 15 most frequently used, significant words in the critics' reviews
